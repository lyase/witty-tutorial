In this lesson we'll see what we need to serve static content.

There are two directory related command line options that you pass to your app, which can be accessed from inside your app:

  --docroot arg                 document root for static files, optionally 
                                followed by a comma-separated list of paths 
                                with static files (even if they are within a 
                                deployment path), after a ';' 
                                
                                e.g. --docroot=".;/favicon.ico,/resources,/style"

   --approot arg                application root for private support files; if 
                                unspecified, the value of the environment 
                                variable $WT_APP_ROOT is used, or else the 
                                current working directory

What I like to do is put the docroot in a separate subdirectory of the app dir, like /static.

When developing and debugging, the app itself will serve these.

In deployment it's common to have nginx or ha-proxy serve these for you.

However, for myself I like to have this url be configurable, as I like to serve static files from a CDN in deployment. I use Rackspace Cloud Files, which includes use af the Akamai CDN, probably the biggest one in the world.
